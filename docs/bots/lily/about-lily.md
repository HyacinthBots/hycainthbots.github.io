::: warning Self-Hosting is not supported
Self-hosting presents its own issues and can produce unexpected errors. For this reason we do not officially support
self-hosting instances of LilyBot.

That being said, we **will not** go out of our way to stop you from self-hosting LilyBot, you are free to do so as you 
wish. Be aware that support will not be provided for a self-hosted instance as we are not able to know what changes you 
have or have not made. If you find bugs in your self-hosted instance, please make sure you can reproduce it with the official
